# EcoGrow: Innovating Sustainable AgriTech.

# OVERVIEW
Farmers face various challenges such as rising temperatures, and unpredictable weather patterns, leading to crop failure and reduced yields. To help them in avoiding the adverse effects of climate and other factors.

We've introduced EcoGrow which combines IoT-integrated smart farming techniques, particularly gene editing for sustainable agriculture. This approach allows scientists to directly modify a plant's genes, boosting yields, enhancing resistance to disease and pests, and enabling crops to survive in challenging environments.

This results in efficient resource consumption through water management, with IoT sensors monitoring soil moisture levels for precise irrigation, and fertilizer optimization through data-driven decisions to minimize fertilizer use. Also, IoT monitoring provides real-time climate data for adaptive responses, ensuring crop survival, while habitat monitoring aids conservation efforts. And, IoT pest detection enables early identification to prevent pests and diseases without excessive spraying.

Overall, integrating IoT and gene editing supports sustainable farming practices and improves farm profitability.
